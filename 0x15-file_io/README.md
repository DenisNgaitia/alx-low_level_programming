#Shell File I/O Project
This project is aimed at demonstrating various file input/output (I/O) operations in the shell scripting language. The scripts included in this project provide examples of reading from and writing to files, manipulating file descriptors, and handling errors associated with file I/O operations.

##Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

read_file.sh: This script demonstrates how to read data from a file using different techniques, such as reading line by line or reading the entire content at once.

write_file.sh: This script showcases different methods of writing data to a file, including appending to an existing file or creating a new file.

file_descriptors.sh: This script illustrates the manipulation of file descriptors, such as redirecting input/output to files or closing file descriptors.

error_handling.sh: This script focuses on error handling while performing file I/O operations. It demonstrates techniques to detect and handle errors that may occur during file operations.
